# System Commands

This repo is meant to share my learnings form the System Commands course of the IITM BS data science degree course. 
The repo has : 

1. Assignment Folder - Folder with assignments codes and reasons.
2. Lecture Notes - Made from the lectures taken from live class.
3. BPT Codes - Meant to have the BPT codes.
4. Supplementary - All the stuff that I cannot categorise properly

## Resources
- [IITM BS System Commands Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BSSE2001)

## Important Guideline
- IITM has no relation with the repo, it's just my document for public learning.
- I do not endorse solution sharing, the questions and solutions present are only for learning.
- Please do your assignments by yourself.

Thank you and Happy Learning!
